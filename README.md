## 🛠 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnshikaAsthana/Artificial-Intelligence.git
cd Artificial-Intelligence
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run a sample notebook

Open `notebooks/PlayTennis_ID3.ipynb` in Jupyter to see the ID3 algorithm applied to the Play Tennis dataset.
Step through, tweak parameters, and observe how the decision tree constructs and predicts.

### 4. Explore other notebooks and modules

Check out `src/decision_tree.py`, `src/logistic_regression.py`, and accompanying notebooks for extra learning paths.
